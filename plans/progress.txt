# Kanban Board Progress

## Issue #3: Board navigation & view [DONE]
- Fixed `columns.list` to sort by `position` field (was returning unsorted)
- Created `KanbanBoard` and `KanbanColumn` presentational components in `src/components/ui/kanban/` (compose shadcn Card, no Convex imports)
- Updated `src/routes/boards/$boardId.tsx` to query columns and render them via `KanbanBoard`, replacing the placeholder
- Added Convex tests for `boards.get` (single board by ID) and `columns.list` (position ordering)
- Commit: fccd04d

## Issue #4: Column creation [DONE]
- Added `columns.create` mutation that appends new column at max position + 1 (`convex/columns.ts`)
- Added "Add Column" button + dialog to `KanbanBoard` presentational component (`src/components/ui/kanban/kanban-board.tsx`)
- Wired `createColumn` mutation in board route container (`src/routes/boards/$boardId.tsx`)
- Added 2 Convex tests: appending after existing columns, first column on empty board (`convex/columns.test.ts`)
- Commit: 632e5fc

## Next up
- Issue #4 continued: Column rename (click-to-rename header + `columns.rename` mutation + test)
