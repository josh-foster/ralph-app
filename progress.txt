# Kanban Board Progress

## Phase 1: Boards (Issue #2) — DONE
- Added `boards`, `columns`, and `cards` tables to Convex schema with indexes
- Created `convex/boards.ts` (create, list, get) — board creation auto-generates three default columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Created `convex/columns.ts` (list query by boardId)
- Added convex-test + @edge-runtime/vm, configured vitest for edge-runtime environment
- Wrote 3 tests: board creation with default columns, board listing by user, empty listing
- Created board list page at `/boards` with "Create Board" dialog (presentational/container split)
- Created board view placeholder at `/boards/$boardId` with breadcrumb navigation (Home > Boards > Board Name)
- Added "Boards" entry to sidebar navigation with Columns3 icon
- Installed shadcn Dialog component
- Files: convex/schema.ts, convex/boards.ts, convex/columns.ts, convex/boards.test.ts, src/components/board-list.tsx, src/components/app-sidebar.tsx, src/routes/boards/index.tsx, src/routes/boards/$boardId.tsx, src/components/ui/dialog.tsx, vitest.config.ts
